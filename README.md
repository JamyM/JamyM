- 👋 Hi, I’m @JamyM. I'm currently an Educational Specialist for the Blind and Visually Impaired. In this career, I discovered my love for assistive technology. I want to learn computer coding so I can help create accessible technology to better support those with disabilities.  
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the foundational skills for coding that I can build from.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the traits of successful coding students through the Foundational Skills section of the Odin Project. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future projects and connect with those that specialize in Accessibility Coding. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Jamy.Pitts@gmail.com
